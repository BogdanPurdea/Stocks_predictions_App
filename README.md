## About the Project

This project was created as part of [Scrimba's AI Engineer Path](https://scrimba.com/the-ai-engineer-path-c02v).

The app is deployed using Cloudflare and utilizes Cloudflare Workers to handle API requests to the Polygon API and OpenAI API. Additionally, Cloudflare's AI Gateway is used to cache generated responses from the OpenAI API, improving performance and reducing redundant API calls.

You can check out the deployed app here: [Deployed App](https://stocks-predictions-app.pages.dev/).
